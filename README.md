GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS GUYS
dont do illegal stuff with this lol, ask for consent btw
this is here as a proof of concept, it is discouraged to try using this to pen test or exploit vulnerabilities without consent or illegally.

anyways, put your stuff in IPPORT in this format for the server machine details:
IPv6
IPv4
any Port to use

and you're pretty much done, custom commands are 'k1' 'k0' for keylogging, 'stream' for streaming the first display on the client's computer, screenshot to take a screenshot that is saved on the server computer.

CLIENT IS testrat, SERVER IS testserver
